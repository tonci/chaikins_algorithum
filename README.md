chaikins_algorithum
===================



This is Perl implementation of Chaikin`s algorithm.

It starts from a web page and has two options of Input:

  1.Basic input - Here the user can enter manually points in a input field by space For example x1:10 y1:10, x2:10 y2:100 
  must be entered like 10 10 10 100 
  The second field is "Iterations" where a user enters how many iterations will be applied by the algorithm

  2.Polygon entry - Here the user can enter the polygon by clicking on the black field with the mouse. Here we have again an "Iterations" field where the user have to enter how many iterations he wants to apply to the algorithm.

On the right sight there is a result image. 
This image is representation of the generated image by the Perl script.
